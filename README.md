# Android-Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This is a simple Android Tic-Tac-Toe Game that I created in Android Studio which emphasizes on the design part. The code includes special animation for the "Launch Screen" Texts and the "Add Player" Screen.

I have used <a href="https://www.figma.com">Figma</a> to do the designing of the Backgrounds and the Logos.

Hope you find it useful and the code for the project is in the <b>"master"</b> branch.
